# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an email notification system that sends automated emails to participants when specific events occur in the registration system. The system uses SQS for asynchronous message processing and Maileroo SDK for email delivery with templated emails using template IDs. The notification system is stage-aware and integrates seamlessly with the existing event registration infrastructure.

## Glossary

- **Email_Notification_System**: The complete system responsible for sending automated emails to participants
- **Maileroo_Client**: The SDK client initialized with MailerooClient using API key for sending templated emails
- **Template_ID**: Numeric identifier for email templates stored in Maileroo
- **Template_Data**: Key-value pairs containing dynamic content for email template rendering
- **SQS_Queue**: Amazon Simple Queue Service queue for asynchronous message processing
- **Registration_Handler**: Lambda functions that process registration requests
- **Payment_Handler**: Lambda functions that process payment status updates

## Requirements

4. WHEN registration email is sent THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL use the participant's email address as the recipient in EmailAddress format
5. WHEN email sending fails THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL log the error and retry according to SQS retry policy

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a participant, I want to receive an email notification when my payment status is updated to paid, so that I know my registration is fully confirmed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN payment status is updated from unpaid to paid THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL send a payment confirmation email using payment confirmation Template_ID
2. WHEN sending payment confirmation emails THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL include confirmation number, event details, payment information, and next steps in Template_Data
3. WHEN payment confirmation is for team registration THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL send the email to the team captain using EmailAddress format
4. WHEN payment confirmation email is sent THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL include the transfer reference and payment date in Template_Data
5. WHEN payment confirmation fails to send THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL log the error and retry according to SQS retry policy

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want email notifications to be processed asynchronously via SQS, so that the registration process is not blocked by email delivery delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a registration is successful THEN the Registration_Handler SHALL publish an email notification message to the appropriate SQS_Queue
2. WHEN payment status is updated THEN the Payment_Handler SHALL publish a payment confirmation message to the appropriate SQS_Queue
3. WHEN SQS message is received THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL process the message and send the appropriate email using Maileroo_Client
4. WHEN email processing fails THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL use SQS dead letter queue for failed messages
5. WHEN SQS_Queue receives messages THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL process them in order with appropriate retry logic

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the email system to be stage-aware with proper resource naming, so that infrastructure resources follow the existing naming conventions and can be deployed across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating SQS queues THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL use the existing stage name and stack prefix naming mechanism for resource identification
2. WHEN creating Lambda functions THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL follow the existing naming convention with stage and stack prefix
3. WHEN creating IAM roles and policies THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL use stage-aware naming for proper resource isolation
4. WHEN configuring environment variables THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL use stage-appropriate values for Maileroo_Client configuration including Template_ID mappings
5. WHEN deploying across stages THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL maintain separate resource instances per stage

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to use Maileroo SDK with templated emails, so that emails are sent reliably using predefined templates with dynamic content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending emails THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL use Maileroo_Client.sendTemplatedEmail method
2. WHEN calling sendTemplatedEmail THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL provide from address, to address, subject, template_id, and template_data parameters
3. WHEN configuring sender address THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL use EmailAddress with noreply email and application name
4. WHEN email delivery succeeds THEN the Maileroo_Client SHALL return a reference ID for tracking
5. WHEN email delivery fails THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL capture Maileroo error details for debugging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want email templates to support both individual and team registration scenarios using Maileroo template IDs, so that participants receive appropriate content based on their registration type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN individual registration is successful THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL use individual registration Template_ID with single participant Template_Data
2. WHEN team registration is successful THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL use team registration Template_ID with team and member Template_Data
3. WHEN payment is confirmed THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL use payment confirmation Template_ID regardless of registration type
4. WHEN preparing Template_Data THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL populate all required template variables with participant and event data
5. WHEN Template_Data is incomplete THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL use default values to prevent template rendering errors

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging for email operations, so that I can troubleshoot delivery issues and monitor system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN email processing starts THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL log the message details and processing attempt
2. WHEN email delivery succeeds THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL log success with Maileroo reference ID and delivery confirmation details
3. WHEN email delivery fails THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL log detailed error information including Maileroo_Client response
4. WHEN SQS message processing fails THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL log the failure and allow SQS retry mechanism
5. WHEN maximum retry attempts are reached THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL send the message to dead letter queue with error details

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure Maileroo template IDs and use the sendTemplatedEmail method, so that emails are sent using predefined templates with proper data binding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing email service THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL create Maileroo_Client using MailerooClient constructor with API key
2. WHEN configuring email templates THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL map each email type to a specific Template_ID
3. WHEN calling sendTemplatedEmail THEN the Maileroo_Client SHALL receive from EmailAddress, to EmailAddress, subject, Template_ID, and Template_Data parameters
4. WHEN creating EmailAddress objects THEN the Email_Notification_System SHALL provide email address and display name using EmailAddress constructor
5. WHEN sendTemplatedEmail succeeds THEN the Maileroo_Client SHALL return a reference ID for tracking

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the email notification system to integrate seamlessly with existing registration handlers, so that notifications are triggered automatically without code duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Registration_Handler complete successfully THEN they SHALL publish notification messages to SQS_Queue
2. WHEN Payment_Handler complete successfully THEN they SHALL publish payment confirmation messages to SQS_Queue
3. WHEN publishing SQS messages THEN the handlers SHALL include all necessary data for Template_Data population
4. WHEN SQS publishing fails THEN the handlers SHALL log the error but not fail the main registration operation
5. WHEN Email_Notification_System is unavailable THEN the registration system SHALL continue to function normally
