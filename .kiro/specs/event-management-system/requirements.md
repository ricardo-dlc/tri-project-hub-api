# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables comprehensive event and organizer management functionality including creating, updating, and deleting events and organizers. The system will enforce business rules for team events, validate ownership permissions, and maintain data consistency. A separate organizer entity will be created to normalize organizer data and allow reuse across multiple events. The event model will be updated to align with other models by using ULID-based composite keys instead of plain primary keys.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an event creator, I want to create new events with all necessary details, so that participants can discover and register for my events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates an event THEN the system SHALL generate a ULID-based event ID
2. WHEN a user creates an event THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields are provided
3. WHEN a user creates a team event THEN the system SHALL validate that maxParticipants is a multiple of requiredParticipants
4. WHEN a user creates an event THEN the system SHALL set the creatorId to the authenticated user's ID
5. WHEN a user creates an event THEN the system SHALL require a valid organizerId
6. WHEN a user creates an event THEN the system SHALL validate the organizer exists and is accessible to the user
7. WHEN a user creates an event THEN the system SHALL generate a globally unique slug based on the event title
8. WHEN a user creates an event THEN the system SHALL ensure the slug is immutable after creation
9. WHEN a user creates an event THEN the system SHALL set createdAt and updatedAt timestamps
10. WHEN a user creates an event THEN the system SHALL set currentParticipants to 0
11. WHEN a user creates an event THEN the system SHALL set isEnabled to true by default

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an event creator, I want to update my existing events, so that I can modify details and keep information current.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user updates an event THEN the system SHALL verify the user is the event creator OR an admin
2. WHEN a user updates an event THEN the system SHALL validate the event exists
3. WHEN a user updates a team event's maxParticipants THEN the system SHALL validate it remains a multiple of requiredParticipants
4. WHEN a user updates an event THEN the system SHALL update the updatedAt timestamp
5. WHEN a user updates an event THEN the system SHALL preserve the original createdAt timestamp
6. WHEN a user updates an event THEN the system SHALL not allow modification of the event ID, creatorId, or slug

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an event creator, I want to delete my events, so that I can remove cancelled or outdated events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user deletes an event THEN the system SHALL verify the user is the event creator OR an admin
2. WHEN a user deletes an event THEN the system SHALL validate the event exists
3. WHEN a user deletes an event THEN the system SHALL remove the event from the database
4. WHEN a user deletes an event with existing registrations THEN the system SHALL prevent deletion and return an error
5. WHEN an admin deletes any event THEN the system SHALL allow the deletion regardless of creator

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage any event in the system, so that I can maintain platform quality and handle support requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin creates an event THEN the system SHALL allow creation with any valid creatorId
2. WHEN an admin updates any event THEN the system SHALL bypass ownership validation
3. WHEN an admin deletes any event THEN the system SHALL bypass ownership validation
4. WHEN an admin performs event operations THEN the system SHALL log the admin action for audit purposes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the event model to use consistent patterns with other models, so that the codebase maintains consistency and follows established conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the event model is updated THEN it SHALL use ULID validation for the event ID
2. WHEN the event model is updated THEN it SHALL use composite primary keys instead of plain string IDs
3. WHEN the event model is updated THEN it SHALL follow the same validation patterns as the registration model
4. WHEN the event model is updated THEN it SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing data
5. WHEN the event model is updated THEN it SHALL preserve all existing indexes and access patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system, I want to enforce team event business rules, so that team registrations work correctly and events can accommodate full teams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating team event capacity THEN the system SHALL ensure maxParticipants is divisible by requiredParticipants
2. WHEN a team event is created with invalid capacity THEN the system SHALL return a validation error
3. WHEN a team event is updated with invalid capacity THEN the system SHALL return a validation error
4. WHEN calculating available team slots THEN the system SHALL use (maxParticipants / requiredParticipants) formula

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an event creator, I want to create and manage organizer profiles, so that I can reuse organizer information across multiple events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates an organizer THEN the system SHALL generate a ULID-based organizer ID
2. WHEN a user creates an organizer THEN the system SHALL validate the user is authenticated via Clerk
3. WHEN a user creates an organizer THEN the system SHALL link the organizer to the user's Clerk ID
4. WHEN a user creates an organizer THEN the system SHALL validate all required organizer fields
5. WHEN a user creates an organizer THEN the system SHALL ensure only one organizer per Clerk ID
6. WHEN a user attempts to create a duplicate organizer THEN the system SHALL return the existing organizer
7. WHEN a user creates an organizer THEN the system SHALL set createdAt and updatedAt timestamps

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an organizer, I want to update my organizer profile, so that I can keep my contact information and details current.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user updates an organizer THEN the system SHALL verify the user owns the organizer OR is an admin
2. WHEN a user updates an organizer THEN the system SHALL validate the organizer exists
3. WHEN a user updates an organizer THEN the system SHALL update the updatedAt timestamp
4. WHEN a user updates an organizer THEN the system SHALL preserve the original createdAt timestamp
5. WHEN a user updates an organizer THEN the system SHALL not allow modification of the organizer ID or Clerk ID
6. WHEN an admin updates any organizer THEN the system SHALL bypass ownership validation

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system, I want events to reference organizers by ID, so that organizer data is normalized and reusable across multiple events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an event is created THEN the system SHALL require a valid organizer ID
2. WHEN an event is created THEN the system SHALL validate the organizer exists
3. WHEN an event is created THEN the system SHALL link the event to the organizer via organizerId field
4. WHEN an event is retrieved THEN the system SHALL be able to join with organizer data
5. WHEN an organizer is deleted THEN the system SHALL prevent deletion if events reference it

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want consistent error handling and responses, so that I can handle different scenarios appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthorized user attempts event or organizer operations THEN the system SHALL return a 403 Forbidden error
2. WHEN a user attempts to operate on a non-existent event or organizer THEN the system SHALL return a 404 Not Found error
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return a 400 Bad Request error with detailed field errors
4. WHEN an event has registrations and deletion is attempted THEN the system SHALL return a 409 Conflict error
5. WHEN an organizer has events and deletion is attempted THEN the system SHALL return a 409 Conflict error
6. WHEN operations succeed THEN the system SHALL return appropriate success status codes (200, 201, 204)
